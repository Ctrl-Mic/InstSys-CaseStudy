    "response": "Hello! I'm glad you asked. SpongeBob SquarePants is a fictional character and the main protagonist of the animated television series of the same name. He's a cheerful, optimistic, and somewhat dim-witted sea sponge who lives in a pineapple under the sea. SpongeBob is known for his square shape, short height, and his iconic yellow shirt with a red tie. He works as a fry cook at the Krusty Krab, a fast-food restaurant owned by his boss, Mr. Krabs. SpongeBob's adventures often involve his friends, including his best friend Patrick Star, and various sea creatures in the underwater city of Bikini Bottom. The show is popular for its humor, catchy songs, and relatable themes about friendship and perseverance."
